# ### âœ… Final List (Problems Without `if` or `loop`)

# 1. Write a program that takes your **name** and **age** as input and prints:
#    `"Hello [name], you are [age] years old!"`.

# 2. Ask the user for two numbers and print their **sum, difference, product, and division**.

# 3. Convert a userâ€™s input string into an **integer** and print its square.

# 4. Take a string as input and print its **first and last character**.

# 5. Store 5 of your favorite fruits in a **list** and print the **second and last fruit**.

# 6. Create a **list of numbers** from 1 to 10. Print the **sum of all numbers**.
#    *(No loop â†’ just manually create the list and use `sum()`.)*

# 7. Write a program that stores student info in a **dictionary** like:

# ```python
# {"name": "John", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
# ```

# Then print the studentâ€™s name and grade.

# 11. Take a sentence as input and print it in **reverse order**.
#     *(Using slicing, no loop needed.)*

# 12. Given a list of numbers, find the **maximum and minimum**.
#     *(Use `max()` and `min()` directly.)*

# 13. Write a program that merges two dictionaries:

# ```python
# d1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
# d2 = {"c": 3, "d": 4}
# ```

# 19. Create a dictionary where keys are numbers `1â€“5` and values are their **squares**. Example: `{1:1, 2:4, 3:9}`.
#     *(Manually write dictionary without loops.)*
